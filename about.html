<h1>About</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Luke, I'm a yr 11 art student.</p>
<p>I've always had a fascination with looking at and creating art ever since I was little, but I've really only started doing more art focused stuff a few years ago. I mostly do drawings with pens and pencils as a hobby in my free time, while also doing many other different forms of art at school. Most of my artworks consist of small sky islands, 2d landscapes and nature in a simple / minimalistic style. One day, I hope to improve my art skills to even greater heights and that I'll be able to inspire other people with the art I create.  </p>
