    <p>Workshop 2: Introduction to Form.</p>
	<p>Artwork Name: Apple Drawing</p>
	<p>Created: 2/03/23 </p>
	<p>Medium: Greylead pencils.</p>
	<p>Description: For this artwork I had to look at a picture of an apple and try to redraw it. I first started by drawing the outline of the apple and the shadow behind it with a 2b greylead pencil, then I slowly shaded the inside of the shadow with a 2b, 4b and 6b pencil, in that order from lightest to darkest. I also used a blending stump to blend the greys together and make it look more smooth. Once I filled in the shadow, I then slowly built up the shading for the apple using the same techniques as before.</p>

   <p>Artwork Name: Untitled </p>
	<p>Created: 9/03/23 </p>
	<p>Medium: Greylead pencils</p>
	<p>Description: When making this artwork, I first started by bringing 3 objects from home to school, then put them onto the table I was sitting at and tried to draw the objects in perpective by just looking at them and drawing at the same time. It did work, but while I was doing my first attempt, I felt the shadows were a bit difficult to see. So on my second attempt, I decided to put a plane A3 sheet of paper behind them to act as the background and to make the shadows easier to see. Finially, I then redrew the objects and shaded in all of the shadows and highlights.</p>

	<p>Fundamentals Workshop 5: Foreshortening</p>
   <p>Artwork Name: Fish-eye Lens Cat Drawing </p>
	<p>Created: 16/03/23 </p>
	<p>Medium: Greylead pencils </p>
	<p>Description: I first started this artwork by first looking for a picture on pinterest that had some kind of foreshortening effect in it, then I printed out the image and drew a grid over the top of it to measure the size of the image. Once done, I got an A5 piece of paper, then drew a grid on it and looked at the picture as i drew it onto the paper at the same time, I tried to make sure that what I was drawing lined up with the grid on the image and the paper. Once I finished the outline, I then quickly shaded anything in.</p>

	<p>Photography Workshop 5: Mixed media</p>
   <p>Artwork Name: Untitled </p>
	<p>Created: 1/06/23 </p>
	<p>Medium: Mixed media</p>
	<p>Description: I created this artwork by having one of my darkroom prints printed onto normal paper, then I ripped off te edges of the paper to make the print look like an old photo stuck into a book. After I ripped the edges, I then got watercolour and painted over all of the leaves within the photo with different colours to make it seem like the photo featured different colours and species of plants.</p>

   <p>Artwork Name: Untitled </p>
	<p>Created: 23/02/23 </p>
	<p>Medium: greylead pencils</p>
	<p>Description: When creating this artwork, I first started by looking at a reference image of cubes with a ribbon going through them, I then started to recreate it by first drawing a horzion line and two vanishing points. 	After that, I drew all the cubes while making sure to connect all of the lines to the vanishing points. Finally I drew all of the outlines for the cubes, then added in the ribbon and shaded in all of the dark and lights part of the artwork and added in grass, a sky, clouds and a sun.</p>
