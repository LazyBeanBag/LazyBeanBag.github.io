    <p>Artworks Name: Ice coffee and chip packet gifs</p>
	<p>Created: 2020 </p>
	<p>Medium: Photopea, digital manipulation. </p>
	<p>Description: I created these artworks by first finding two seprate images of a dare ice coffee and a packet of honey, soy, chicken chips on google, then I printed out both of the images, and got a light board and a few pieces of paper, to draw each frames of the gifs. I then put the image of ice coffee on the light board and traced it onto another plain piece of paper, then added my own text for the name and type of ice coffee on the bottle label. I then traced it multiple times in different angles and added more bubbles to it as I went, for the last frame I wanted to make it look like the bottle cap fell off after the bottle had been shaked alot, so I drew the bottle cap on the ground, with the coffee spilling out of the bottle. I drew the chip packet in a similar way except I changed the design of the packet as a whole and added extra lines as I drew each frame. After I drew all of the frames, I went over all of the outlines on all of the frames for both the chips and coffee, then I took photos of all of them and uploaded them onto my computer. Next I used a program called Photopea to animate the gifs by first putting all of the frames of each gif into the program in the right order, then I got rid of the backgrounds for each of them and coloured them in, once that was done, I then saved and exported them both as gifs and they're complete.  </p>

    <p>Artwork Name: Gold Sparkly Acrylic Cat Keychains </p>
	<p>Created: 17/03/23 </p>
	<p>Medium: laser cutting, digital manipulation.</p>
	<p>Description: I started creating this artwork at school by first planning what kind of product I wanted to create and what theme I wanted to do. I decided on the idea to create a cat themed keychain and started drawing a few rough sketches, I then made a final design and decided what material I wanted my final product to be made of. A few weeks later, I went to a workshop at BNTS -- Banyule Nillumbik Tech School, while there I used a program called illustrator to redraw the final design multiple times, so that I can lazer cut a lot of them. While I was drawing them, I had to make sure to fill in certain parts of them and change colour of others, becuase in order for the laser cutter to work, it needs a certain shade of red to cut the material and stuff filled in with black to tell the machine to engrave the material. So I made all of the put I wanted to engrave black and the places where I wanted to cut red. Once I finished drawing all of them, I then saved the file and gave it to the people running the workshop. A few weeks later, I got my all of my keychains that I made and they turned out looking really good.   </p>

    <p>Artwork Name: 3D printed pencil holder </p>
	<p>Created: 5/05/23 </p>
	<p>Medium: 3d printing</p>
	<p>Description: I started making this artwork when I went to another workshop at BNTS -- Banyule Nillumbik Tech School. When making the pencil holder I used a program called SolidWorks on one of they're computers, I first started this artwork by making the base square shape, then I added a cylinder into the corner of the square and hollowed out holes in the cyliner and some different sized rectangle holes within the square. Once I had finished the design, I then waited a few weeks for it to print out, and got it back at at school.  </p>
