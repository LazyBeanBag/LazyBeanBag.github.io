    <p>Artwork Name: Lines</p>
	<p>Created: 2022  </p>
	<p>Medium: Digital camera, Photoshop</p>
	<p>Description: For this artwork, I started by choosing the art element "Line", then going around my school and taking photos of that art element within everyday things like walls, fences, drains, and more, then I selected 16 of the best photos and put all of them into photoshop and cropped them. Finally, I then set all the pictures into a grid pattern and upped the brightness and contrast to create the final artwork.  </p>

    <p>Artworks Name: Abandoned Tech</p>
	<p>Created: 2022 </p>
	<p>Medium: Digital camera, digital manipulation </p>
	<p>Description: I started creating these artworks by first planning out what theme I wanted to do, I then decided to make a artwork centered around the idea of someone exploring an abandoned building while recording a video and stumbling Upon old technology covered by plants. I also wanted the final artwork to look like it was being flimed on a old or gitchy camera. I decided to buy some fake plants and grass at the shop so I could take them to school and use them to create the foliage. I also found a box of unused and broken stuff in a storage room, so I decided to use some of the things in it. I took out a computer, a camera, dvds and wires. Then I laid out the fake grass on top of a table and placed all of the objects on top, then moved them around until I was happy with the layout, after that, I added all of the fake leaves and plants all around the objects. </p>
	
	<p>After I finished setting up the scene, I then took a photo using a digital camera and uploaded it into photoshop to start adding extra effects. I created the first artwork by getting an image of tv static from google and putting it over the top of my photo, then I lowered the opacity of the tv static, so it looks like an old camera effect and messed around the brightness, contrast and saturation to get the dark and old effect I wanted. I thne created the second image using the same techniques, but I also added an anaygph effect to make it seem more gitchy.  </p>

<p>Photography Workshop 1: final art: creepy eyes</p>
	<p>Artwork Name: Creepy Eyes</p>
	<p>Created: 8/05/23 </p>
	<p>Medium: Digital camera, photoshop, photo manipulation</p>
	<p>Description: I created this artwork by taking a photo of small purple flowers that i had at my school, then took a photo of some eyes I had drawn in my book. After that, I put both them in photoshop and edited them to be black and white. Once i did that, I put the eyes in a layer below the picture of flowers, and lowered the opacity of the flowers, to make the eyes look like they are behind the flowers. Finally, I turned up the brightness of the eyes to make them more visible and adjusted the contrast of the artwork as a whole.   </p>

<p>Photography Workshop 2: final artworks: nightmare and inverted copy</p>
	<p>Artwork Name: Nightmare </p>
	<p>Created: 11/05/23</p>
	<p>Medium: Self portrait, photo manipulation, photoshop</p>
	<p>Description: I created this artwork by first getting a self portrait photo of me sitting down covering my face, then got the same photo of the eyes I drew and uploaded both of them into photoshop, I then got rid of the background around the eyes and around my self protrait, then I put the eyes behind the self portrait and lowered the opacity to make the eye slighty less visible, I then upped the brightness and contrast. Once the artwork was finished, I saved two version of it, one in black and white, with the other one being inverted. </p>

<p>Photography Workshop 5: Mixed Media: Untitled</p>
	<p>Artwork Name: Untitled </p>
	<p>Created: 6/05/23  </p>
	<p>Medium: Mixed media.</p>
	<p>Description: When creating this artwork, I first started by printing out a picture of my abstract self portrait that I sent through the darkroom, onto photographic rag paper. I then got a set of watercolours and combined a lot of water with the paint to make it more see-through, then painted random spots on my jacket with green, pink, orange, blue and yellow, and on some of the eyes in the background. I ended up finding really shiny brozne tape and decided to cut into wavy shapes, then use it to create a border around my self portrait as a finishing touch.  </p>
